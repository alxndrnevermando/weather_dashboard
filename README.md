# weather_dashboard

This application is a simple weather dashboard that displays real time weather data using the OpenWeatherMap API. Users can search for almost any city in the world, and get back real time data. Additionally, the users searches are stored in a list, which the user can select again in order to get the data displayed to them once more.
